    <title><![CDATA[Ropewalkers]]></title>
    <url>%2F1970%2F01%2F01%2FRopewalkers%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[RopewalkersPolycarp decided to relax on his weekend and visited to the performance of famous ropewalkers: Agafon, Boniface and Konrad. The rope is straight and infinite in both directions. At the beginning of the performance, Agafon, Boniface and Konrad are located in positions aa, bb and cc respectively. At the end of the performance, the distance between each pair of ropewalkers was at least dd. Ropewalkers can walk on the rope. In one second, only one ropewalker can change his position. Every ropewalker can change his position exactly by 11 (i. e. shift by 11 to the left or right direction on the rope). Agafon, Boniface and Konrad can not move at the same time (Only one of them can move at each moment). Ropewalkers can be at the same positions at the same time and can “walk past each other”. You should find the minimum duration (in seconds) of the performance. In other words, find the minimum number of seconds needed so that the distance between each pair of ropewalkers can be greater or equal to dd. Ropewalkers can walk to negative coordinates, due to the rope is infinite to both sides. Input The only line of the input contains four integers aa, bb, cc, dd (1≤a,b,c,d≤1091≤a,b,c,d≤109). It is possible that any two (or all three) ropewalkers are in the same position at the beginning of the performance. Output Output one integer — the minimum duration (in seconds) of the performance. `` 123456789101112131415161718#include &lt;bits/stdc++.h&gt;using namespace std;using ll = long long;int main()&#123; int a, b, c, d; cin &gt;&gt; a &gt;&gt; b &gt;&gt; c &gt;&gt; d; int x[]=&#123;a,b,c&#125;; sort(x,x+3); cout&lt;&lt;max(0,d-abs(x[0]-x[1]))+max(0,d-abs(x[1]-x[2]))&lt;&lt;'\n'; return 0;&#125;]]></content>

    <title><![CDATA[Email from Polycarp]]></title>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Email from PolycarpMethodius received an email from his friend Polycarp. However, Polycarp’s keyboard is broken, so pressing a key on it once may cause the corresponding symbol to appear more than once (if you press a key on a regular keyboard, it prints exactly one symbol). For example, as a result of typing the word “hello”, the following words could be printed: “hello”, “hhhhello”, “hheeeellllooo”, but the following could not be printed: “hell”, “helo”, “hhllllooo”. Note, that when you press a key, the corresponding symbol must appear (possibly, more than once). The keyboard is broken in a random manner, it means that pressing the same key you can get the different number of letters in the result. For each word in the letter, Methodius has guessed what word Polycarp actually wanted to write, but he is not sure about it, so he asks you to help him. You are given a list of pairs of words. For each pair, determine if the second word could be printed by typing the first one on Polycarp’s keyboard. Input The first line of the input contains one integer nn (1≤n≤1051≤n≤105) — the number of pairs to check. Further input contains nn descriptions of pairs. The first line of each description contains a single non-empty word ss consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The second line of the description contains a single non-empty word tt consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The lengths of both strings are not greater than 106106. It is guaranteed that the total length of all words ss in the input is not greater than 106106. Also, it is guaranteed that the total length of all words tt in the input is not greater than 106106. Output Output nn lines. In the ii-th line for the ii-th pair of words ss and tt print YES if the word tt could be printed by typing the word ss. Otherwise, print NO. 思路：主串中出现字母的顺序必须在父串中按照相同顺序出现，并且出现的次数必须大于等于父串中字母出现的顺序。 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233343536373839404142#include&lt;iostream&gt;#include&lt;string.h&gt;using namespace std;const int maxn = 1e6 +50;string a,b;int Next[maxn];int m,n;bool su;void fun(string a,string b)&#123; int i=0,j=0; int ii=0,jj=0; while(i&lt;a.size()&amp;&amp;j&lt;b.size()) &#123; ii=i; jj=j; while(ii&lt;a.size()&amp;&amp;a[i]==a[ii])ii++; while(jj&lt;b.size()&amp;&amp;b[j]==b[jj])jj++; if(a[i]!=b[j])su=0; if(abs(ii-i)&gt;abs(jj-j))su=0; i=ii; j=jj; &#125; if(i!=a.size()||j!=b.size()) su=0;&#125;int main()&#123; int n; cin&gt;&gt;n; while(n--) &#123; su=1; cin&gt;&gt;a&gt;&gt;b; fun(a,b); if(su==1) cout&lt;&lt;&quot;YES&quot;&lt;&lt;endl; else cout&lt;&lt;&quot;NO&quot;&lt;&lt;endl; &#125;&#125;`]]></content>
